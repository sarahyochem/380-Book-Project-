Make sure to open _bookdown.yml and update the 3 URLs to replace “YOUR REPO NAME” with the name of your repo. The first file in bookdown is always index.rmd (and the resulting output file, index.html, is the first file GitHub pages will display). Thus, this must be the first file of your book. You can use this first chapter however you want. I suggest adding additional notes that don’t fit specifically in other parts of your book. Note that you can cross-reference headings (and sub-headings, and 3rd level headings, etc). For example, here’s a cross-reference to the Intermediate R chapter: Intermediate R. You can also cross-reference with a custom name, such as this is a link to the Intermediate R chapter.1 I would leave the author as “380 Student” so that your BP remains anonymous, even when displayed online via GitHub Pages. See here for more details.↩︎ "],["introduction-to-r.html", "1 Introduction to R 1.1 Intro to basics 1.2 Vectors 1.3 Matrices 1.4 Factors 1.5 Data frames 1.6 Lists", " 1 Introduction to R https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r (Note: If you do Introduction to R for Finance instead, change the title of this bookdown chapter above and change the DataCamp chapter titles below. Whichever version of Intro to R you do, delete this note) 1.1 Intro to basics You can use the (#) to add comments Arithmic with R Addition: + Subtraction: - Multiplication: * Division: / Exponentation: ^ Modulo: %% Variable Assingment A variable allows you to store a value/object in R. Example: x &lt;- 12; the number 12 is now known as the variable x dessert &lt;-“cookie” To combine multiple variables you use the + Example: my_fruit &lt;- my_apples + my_oranges Basic Data Types in R Numerics: Decimals values like 1.2 Intergers: Whole numbers like 3 Logical: Boolean Vales like True or False Characters: Text The class() command allows you to check the data type of a variable 1.2 Vectors Create a Vector What is a Vector? A vector is a one dimension arrays that can hold numeric data,character data, or logical data. You can create a vector using the function c() and you seperate the vector elements with a comma. Example: numeric_vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) The names() fuction allows you to name the elements of the vector. Example: names(poker_vector) &lt;- c(“Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”, “Thursday”, “Friday”) Note: Use assinging values/object to a variable to make it faster and easier. The sum() function calculates the sum of all elements of a vector. To compare totals of vectors use &gt; and it will tell you if the statement is TRUE or False Example: total_poker &gt; total_roulette; TRUE To select a certain element of the vector use []. When selecting multiple elements use the c() inside of the brackets. Alternative to the function c() is to use the : Example: poker_vector[c(1,2,3)] to poker_vector[1:3] The mean() fucntion calculates the average values in the vector. Logical comparison operators are: &lt; for less than &gt; for greater than &lt;= for less than or equal to &gt;= for greater than or equal to == for equal to each other != not equal to each other These answers will come out as TRUE or FALSE 1.3 Matrices What is a matrix? A matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Use the matrix() function to create the matrix, if you want your matrix to be filled by rows use “byrow= TRUE”, if you want columns “byrow= FALSE”, also nrow= indicates how many rows. Example: matrix(1:9, byrow=TRUE, nrow=3) Can also use variable names in matrix; matrix(box_office,…) You can add names for the rows and columns of a matrix. Use colnames(nameofmatrix)&lt;-nameofcolum and rownames(nameofmatrix)&lt;-nameofrow Calculate the total of the rows in the matrix create a new vector: rowSums(my_matrix) Calculate the total of the columns in the matrix create a new vector: colSums(my_matrix) The fuction cbind() allows you to add a column or multiple to a matrix. The fuction rbind() allows you to add a row or multiple to a matrix. Selecting Elements of Matrix: my_matrix[1,2] selects the element at the first row and second column. my_matrix[1:3,2:4] results in a matrix with the data on the rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4. my_matrix[,1] selects all elements of the first column. my_matrix[1,] selects all elements of the first row. Notes: You can use arithmetic with matrices(ex: multiply them by eachother) 1.4 Factors The term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables. The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable can belong to a limited number of categories. A continuous variable, on the other hand, can correspond to an infinite number of values. To create a factor: First thing that you have to do is create a vector that contains all the observations that belong to a limited number of categories. The use the function factor() Types of categorical variables: nominal: variable without an implied order ordinal: variables do have a natural ordering To convert variables factor() defalts to transform to unordered factors, To create an ordered factor you have to add ordered and levels Example: factor_speed_vector &lt;- factor(speed_vector, ordered=TRUE, levels=c(“slow”, “medium”, “fast”)) Factors have specfic factor levels, when you want to change the names of these levels use the function levels() The summary() function will give you a quick overview of the contents of the variable. 1.5 Data frames Datah frames can hold numeric, character or logical values. Within a column all elements have the same data type, but different columns can be of different data type. Functions: head() enables you to show the first observations of a data frame. tail() prints out the last observations in your data set. str() shows you the structure of your data set. data.frame() constructs the data frame subset() specfy the data set which you want to create a subset and then use subset= to create the subset Example: subset(planets_df, subset= diameter&lt;1) order() is a function that gives you the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable, such as a vector for example Note: selecting elements is the same as vectors and matrices. Alternative to using numerics is to use variable names. Short cut: planets_df[,“diameter”]=planets_df$diameter 1.6 Lists A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other in any way. To create list use the function list() Example: grocery&lt;- list(apples, oatmeal, chicken, broccil) To give your list names use the function names() Example: names(my_list)&lt;- c(“vec”, “mat”, “df”) When selecting spefic elements use: shining_list[[“reviews”]] or shining_list$reviews Notes: This is different then vectors that uses a single [] "],["intermediate-r.html", "2 Intermediate R 2.1 Conditionals and Control Flow 2.2 Loops 2.3 Functions 2.4 The apply family 2.5 Utilities", " 2 Intermediate R https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r (Note: If you do Intermediate R for Finance instead, change the title of this bookdown chapter above and change the DataCamp chapter titles below.

For each, you will replicate empirical examples from the textbook. The second-level headings (i.e., those with 2 hash tags that show up in the navigation bar of the html files) in each file are labeled with the examples you should replicate. The data is loaded for you using the the wooldridge package (the wooldridge package has datasets from Wooldridge Introductory Economics 6th edition). I also suggest that you add notes on each chapter, but doing so is optional (except if I specify that notes are required). For this chapter, you should do the simple linear regressions from the examples. For each, you should make sure you get the same results as in the example and understand the discussion of the example in the textbook. For this chapter, you should also use ggplot to create a scatter plot of the x and y variables used in the regression, and include a linear regression line. So I suggest doing this chapter after you complete the DataCamp course and your notes on Intro to Data Visualization with ggplot2. These are the packages you will need: library(wooldridge) library(ggplot2) library(pander) For displaying the results of a single regression, you should use the pander package as shown in example 2.3 below. (Later in 380 you will be comparing several regression models side-by-side and will be using the stargazer package instead, but for a single regression model this works well). I completed the first example (Example 2.3: CEO Salary and Return on Equity) for you to demonstrate what you need to do. For the subsequent examples you should fill in the code yourself. I’ve provided the template for you and included the code to load the data. I then added a comment that says “YOUR CODE GOES HERE” wherever you are supposed to add code. You should use the example I did for you as a guide. What you do later in 380 will not be as simple as copy/pasting code I give you and changing a few variable names, for for this chapter as you’re first learning what to do, it’s exactly that easy. Don’t overthink what you’re being asked to do. That said, you are of course welcome to add more if it will help you. You can add more regressions. You can explore the changes of units I talk about in LN2.7. You can experiment with log transformations shown in the later parts of chapter 2 (we’ll talk about these later with chapter 3). But the only things you’re required to do for the BP are the 2 examples I left for you below. 13.1 Notes Optionally, you can add notes here on chapter 2’s (and LN2’s) content. 13.2 Example 2.3: CEO Salary and Return on Equity Load the data from wooldridge package, estimate the regression, and display the results # Load data data(ceosal1) # Estimate regression model ex2.3 &lt;- lm(salary ~ roe, data=ceosal1) # Display model results pander(summary(ex2.3)) Estimate Std.

You don’t need to do anything for these, but you should look at them to make sure you understand them. First, you should understand how to calculate the OLS fitted values, the \\(\\hat{y}\\) values. Below you’ll see two ways to do so. The first is to manually use the OLS regression equation: \\[ \\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i \\] After estimating a model, you can use the coef() function to get the values of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\). We estimated the model above and stored it into the variable ex2.3. We can access \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) with coef(ex2.3)[\"(Intercept)\"] or coef(ex2.3)[1]. We can access the first (and only) \\(x\\) variable is named roe, and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) is coef(ex2.3)[\"roe\"] or coef(ex2.3)[1]. ceosal1$salaryHat &lt;- coef(ex2.3)[&quot;(Intercept)&quot;] + coef(ex2.3)[&quot;roe&quot;] * ceosal1$roe The second way is by using the fitted() function. ceosal1$salaryHat_fitted &lt;- fitted(ex2.3) You can check that these two are the same by subtracting them and making sure they are all the same. ceosal1$dif &lt;- ceosal1$salaryHat - ceosal1$salaryHat_fitted summary(ceosal1$dif) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## -2.046e-12 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 1.469e-14 0.000e+00 1.592e-12 Note that the min is -0.000000000002046363 and the max is 0.000000000001591616. Algebra with decimal numbers often results in small rounding errors, which is why these are 0 exactly, but they are effectively 0, demonstrating that the two methods of calculating the fitted \\((\\hat{y})\\) values are the same. The second reason I’m including this example is to demonstrate plotting the fitted \\((\\hat{y})\\) values. The black circles are the data. The red x’s are the predicted \\((\\hat{y})\\) values (in this setting, “predicted values” and “fitted” values and \\((\\hat{y})\\) all mean the same thing). The blue line is the OLS regression line. You should understand why all of the red x’s are on the blue line. ggplot(data=ceosal1, aes(x=roe, y=salary)) + geom_point(aes(color=&quot;data&quot;,shape=&quot;data&quot;)) + geom_point(aes(x=roe, y=salaryHat,color=&quot;predicted (yHat)&quot;,shape=&quot;predicted (yHat)&quot;)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;,color=&quot;blue&quot;, se=FALSE,aes(linetype=&quot;OLS&quot;)) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot;),name=&quot;Values&quot;) + scale_shape_manual(values = c(1,4),name=&quot;Values&quot;) + scale_linetype_manual(values = c(&quot;solid&quot;,&quot;solid&quot;), name=&quot;Regression Line&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; "]]
